<p> Diwali also known as Deepavali or the Festival of Lights, is one of the most important festivals in Indian religions. It symbolises the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance".The festival is widely associated with conflagrations between good and evil entities. <br>

Diwali is a post-harvest festival celebrating the bounty following the arrival of the monsoon in the subcontinent. It is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November). In Hinduism it generally lasts five or six days.<br>

The festival is an annual homecoming and bonding period not only for families, but also for communities and associations, particularly those in urban areas, which will organise activities, events and gatherings.
